My custom nuke map for CS:GO. It was basically (old new) nuke but with many clip brushes removed and doors changed to be openable

sadly I lost the latest editable version of this map, its possible i have it on a USB somewhere but I doubt it. This version is from April 2019 while the latest was from around October 2019
Maybe one day I'll create a source 2 version from scratch, but I think I'd rather make something new, especially after porting my old nuke map
