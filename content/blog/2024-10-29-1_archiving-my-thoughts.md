In the beginning, there was nothing. 

Then there was an app on my phone. 
It was simple, you mark a colour for each day, then you get a nice graphic eventually. It supported notes but I didn't use that often.

Then there was an app on my phone. 
It was simple, you mark an emotion for each day, then you could look back at the week/month/year. It supported notes and I'd sometimes use them, but generally at the end of the day. The midnight cut-off for each day annoyed me.

Then there was an app on my phone. And my PC. 
It was simple, I'd simply write my (usually negative) thoughts, whenever they occurred, and there they'd stay. Sure, I didn't get a nice graphic but I got a much easier way to dump my specific thoughts as they came though. 

Then there was an app on my phone. And my PC. And my tablet. And it synced. 
It was great, very customisable, made for this exact purpose, I could write my thoughts, whenever they occurred, but this time they had no timestamp. 
Sure, I didn't get a nice graphic but I got a day-to-day gist of my thoughts and feelings. But as time went on, the time and effort to open the app, write whatever and sync it passed my threshold of effort. 
That app is the app I'm currently using to write this-- Obsidian, but now I only use it for this site, and to read through old notes I left in here.
And so I went back to the previous method, which is what I use today..
an empty Discord group.

This group has existed for almost 5 years, but for a long time was just a place to test embeds/images/links/markdown or just dump stuff I needed for later. 

Then, for while, it would also be a place to write my negative thoughts.
I realise I generally log a lot of these thoughts like I'm troubleshooting something. I guess in a way, I am? It reminds me of when I'm [[2024-09-19-2_troubleshooting-my-pc-freezing|Troubleshooting my PC freezing]]

But this Discord channel holds more than just my sad thoughts now. It's where my fleeting thoughts go: ideas, to-dos, and dreams.  
I really like logging my dreams, otherwise they're lost. I think I've heard that its useful if you want to lucid dream.. personally, I just like reading them back.   

But.. this sucks for a lot of reasons, it'd be very easy to lose, is a single long long list and difficult to search.
I long for a better solution.
