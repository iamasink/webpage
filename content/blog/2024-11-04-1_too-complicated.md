Everything is too complicated.
this site.. it's too busy.
I wish it'd be simpler? I guess that's up to me to do though..
But changing stuff is complicated, too.

I don't write much. It's complicated.

This word has lost its meaning now.
I find that it's too easy to hide behind complicated words.

I'm too complicated for myself...
I wish it'd be simpler.
