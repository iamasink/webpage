Everything is too complicated.
My [homepage](https://github.com/iamasink/webpage),
it doesn't need all that.
This [place](https://iamas.ink/blog),
it's too busy.
I wish it'd be simpler.
But changing stuff is complicated, too.

I don't write much. It's complicated.

This word has lost its meaning now.
Be specific but simple when writing about your emotions.
I find that it's too easy to hide behind complicated words.

I'm too complicated for myself...
I wish I'd be simpler.
