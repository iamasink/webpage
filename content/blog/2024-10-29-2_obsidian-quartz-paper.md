# Obsidian
I dread opening [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). 
It takes so long, and then just once I think it's loaded, some stuff moves, or a old note opens, or some other annoyance. Once I've opened it, its _fine_? But definitely isn't perfect. 
I wish I could use the scroll wheel to select multiple lines like in vscode, 
I hate fiddling with the annoying movements of all the text as if I nudged an image in Word. Honestly, this has made me think I'd prefer just using vscode for markdown, I'd only really lose out on some prettiness. But this, too, is effort.
update: this helps [GitHub - alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins: Load plugins with a delay on Obsidian startup, so that you can get your app startup down into the sub-second loading time.](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins)

# Quartz
On a similar note, Quartz (the static site generator that created this place!) is _fine_. 
I think its too complicated, the explorer is weird and I wish I could do more with it. 
The manual syncing by closing Obsidian (or it deletes everything!!!!!), running a batch script, waiting, etcetc. is annoying, but its whatever. 
One day I will find the effort within me to change to something I might actually like. 
I wish that day was today, but my hands ache and I'm tired and I can't be bothered and--.

Random thought that came to me: I also wish I could have hover hints on text. 
update: i switched to using next.js and remark/rehype/unified and some custom stuff
im happier now
# Paper
Like.. the actual physical stuff.
I don't use paper for anything I'll want to look at much later. 
It sometimes acts as a pagefile for my brain, when it's less effort to use a pen than to use the keyboard, which is rare. But diagrams and tables and that generally live here.
My handwriting is awful, and I'm way faster at typing. It wouldn't make sense for me to use it for text.
