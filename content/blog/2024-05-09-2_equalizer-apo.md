I do not want to get into the whole messing with equalisers, im no audiophile, but [AutoEq](https://autoeq.app/) i think makes stuff sound better. 
I use presets from autoeq in Equalizer APO on Windows, and Wavelet on Android.

I often switch between audio devices so here is how to use multiple presets for different devices:

In the Equalizer APO Configurator, setting my earbuds as SFX/EFX didn't seem to work, SFX/MFX does do something, but a lot of stuff is buzzing, even with a flat response 
Disabling pre-mix seems to remove the buzzing with a flat curve but changing anything makes it buzz again. I will just leave it disabled.
