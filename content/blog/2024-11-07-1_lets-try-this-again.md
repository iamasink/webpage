It's time to switch from [[2024-04-27-3_quartz|Quartz]], and probably change my homepage while I'm at it.
I've heard (and seen) good things from [Lume](https://lume.land/) which uses [Deno](deno.com), neither of which I've used before. 

Instead, I spent many hours making a bunch of stuff work with next.js. is this scuffed? yes. do i care? no..t really

:D



oops.
