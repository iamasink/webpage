i dreamed that:  
there was a reason for why these fancy expensive buildings had very tall ceilings. because the fancy expensive people would wear stilts such that they were around 3x their height.  
i* was one of the fancy people, but I had to duck beneath the doorways (which were also tall)

.. but not tall enough. of course it'd make sense to use shorter stilts so it's not a problem. but that didn't happen.  
  
\*i have a lot of dreams where its like my pov but i also don't feel like its me. dreams are weird. or maybe im weird. it's both.

and i have dreams but rarely are they of anything resembling real life. the only time i feel like what im seeing is real is when i pass out**. and it feels really real, and i think im surrounded by people but i wake up and im on the floor with a headache.  
but maybe thats just the different medium of dream. 
i dont really know

\*\*which is pretty rare but happens when i stand up way to quick
