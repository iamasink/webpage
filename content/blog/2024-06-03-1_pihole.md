# filtering the pihole tail output
I want to exclude the extra unnecessary information displayed in grey.
example:
![Pasted image 20240603175427.png](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240603175427.png)
pihole -t \[filter]
include only query and blocked (white and red)
```bash
pihole -t '\(query\[A*\]\|blocked\|blacklisted\)'
```
regex explanation
`(query[A*]|blocked)\`
match `query[A*]` or `blocked`
A* matches A and AAAA (and any other amount of A's which wont ever appear)

new output:

# issues, whitelists and stuff
## epic games, fortnite
these seem to have really annoying connection issues if using unbound as recursive. these aren't blocked queries; they don't even show in the pihole log!
Epic games launcher will refuse to update, and show various connection issues and fortnite will load indefinitely or for like 5+ minutes. I'm tired of these issues so i'll just set my secondary pihole to use cloudflare and hopefully thats fine idk
