I sometimes use capital letters. i sometimes don't.  
Sometimes, I use proper punctuation. i sometimes dont.  
  
There's a lot of interesting ways case and punctuation has changed meaning online. Like it can seem very ominous to receive a proper capitalised and punctuated message depending on context  
But for a less ephemeral use (such as this), it feels a bit weird not to type well, particularly on a keyboard.  
some people have a general style for their text, like- i know of those who dont use capitals for sentences, which is a really cool stylistic choice! particularly with its similarity to [[toki pona]]  
but i think i prefer capitals. maybe full stops are too small for my weak eyes?  
  
though I'd like to be consistent, i probably won't be, and i'm not gonna go edit old stuff for case and punctuation.
